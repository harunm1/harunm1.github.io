        <h1>Privacy Policy:</h1>
        <p>
            Here at L4B(Learning For Babies) no data is collected.
            The app works in such a way that no permissions are required.
            The app does not need access to Wi-Fi and also does not include any ads.
            The app does not need acess to a camera or location. It is designed in such a 
            way that the content is there for the user(child 1-2) to view the layouts and 
            click the images to hear sounds files of the things being clicked. The app does not 
            require location either as mentioned before just like Wi-Fi. It does not require any 
            phone data like contacts, SMS or microphone since the app does not have any functionality
            with regards to the user speaking into the phone. There are no body sensors or calendars 
            since the designer is relatively new to app development as has limited experience. As for 
            storage all that is required is the storage for the app and no extra storage is required.
            In conclusion no data is collected and the app is very static in functionality.
